# GitHub Pages Lightning Talk

A five minute presentation about GitHub Pages, with supporting context.

## The slide deck

The slide dock is in `/docs`. It's implemented in the Shower open source HTML/CSS/JS slide presentation framework, builds via Jekyller, and actually builds and deploys through GitHub Pages running Jekyll to build and deploy the `/docs` directory as a static website.

If I knew what I was doing with Git I'd incorporate `shower` and the `ribbon` theme by reference rather than by copy, but I don't, so this repo simply has a copy of what it needs from those.

## Supporting documentation

The slides will have speaker notes.
