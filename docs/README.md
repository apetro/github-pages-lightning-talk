# This is a GitHub Pages site

Specifically, it's a web page that implements a Shower slide deck, generated via Jekyller.

## Local usage

Try 

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

When that doesn't work, dig into Jekyll and Ruby documentation. :shrug:

## GitHub Pages

GitHub pages automatically generates and hosts the static site from this directry. :smile:
