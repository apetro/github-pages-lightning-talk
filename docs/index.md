# Lightning Talk: GitHub Pages for project documentation

*A quick little lightning talk.*

## Lightning talk

5 minutes.

+ https://github.com/apetro/github-pages-lightning-talk

## What problem are we solving?

+ Your project needs a website
+ A good website
+ A cheap website
+ A sustainable website
+ A low-risk website

## What is GitHub Pages?

+ Websites for individuals, organizations, and projects
+ Hosted by GitHub
+ Generated by Jekyll

## GitHub Pages website solution

+ Source code GitHub repository
+ Generates to website via SaaS Jekyll
+ Hosted by GitHub

## Free

+ Free as in cheapness
+ Free as in a free puppy
+ Free as in a dogsitter
+ Free as in escape route

## Features: HTML

+ You can simply host a static website.
+ Drop in your HTML etc. and GitHub will simply host it for you.

## Features: Git

+ Versioning
+ History

## Features: Jekyll

+ Jekyll is a static site generator.
+ Separate content from presentation.
+ From source code, generates the HTML etc., and *then* GitHub hosts it for you.
+ Source code? Text files. Templates. Themes. Pages. Posts. Includes. Styles. Images. Stuff.

## Example: oaeproject.org

http://oaeproject.org

## Features: Markdown

    ## What is GitHub Pages?
    
    + Websites for individuals, organizations, and projects
    + Hosted by GitHub
    + Generated by Jekyll

## Features: GitHub: Collaboration

+ Branching, merging
+ Pull requests

## Key feature: edit documentation with code

+ Update documentation alongside code documented
+ In the same breath
+ (Website source in a `/docs` folder)

## Features: GitHub: Web-based editing

+ Power tools for developers, and
+ Web-based tools for casual or text-file-disinclined editing.

## Advantages

+ Sustainability
+ Transparency
+ Openness
+ Casual participation
+ Exit strategy

// Sustainability: Continually maintain the documentation with the code being documented
// Transparency: Use Git to inspect the history, intentions, participants in development of the documentation, of the website
// Openness: Not only is the resulting website available, not only is the source for the content of that website available, but the tools are open source and apparent, so anyone can engage with content, tooling, results. Contrast WordPress, where yes, it's open source, but I can't necessarily see the "source" of the site (database content?) and I can't necessarily understand what plugins are being used to generate the site from that.
// Casual participation: Anyone can walk up, fork the website, offer a pull request with a change.
// Exit strategy: the content is text files, so good starting point for importing somewhere else. The tooling is open source, so could operate it outside GitHub. The result is a static website, so lots of options for places to host it other than GitHub.

## What could you build?

+ Project website
+ Personal website
+ Organization website
+ Blog
+ Project documentation, manual
+ Slideware
